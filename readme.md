- **Intelligent Filtering**: Uses GPT-4 and Claude to analyze tender relevance
- **Real-time Notifications**: Instant Telegram updates with structured tender information
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Smart detection to avoid repeated notifications
- **State Management**: Robust tracking of tender processing status
- **Database Persistence**: SQLite storage for tender history and state

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Framework Stack

- **LangGraph**: Orchestrates the workflow between different components
- **LangChain**: Manages interactions with AI models
- **Pydantic**: Ensures data validation and serialization
- **SQLite**: Provides lightweight but reliable data persistence

### Workflow Components

1. **Scraper Node**

   - Fetches tenders from multiple sources
   - Validates and normalizes data
   - Prevents duplicate entries

2. **Filter Node**

   - Analyzes tenders using AI models
   - Applies company-specific criteria
   - Classifies tenders as qualified/unqualified

3. **Notification Node**
   - Formats tender information
   - Delivers updates via Telegram
   - Tracks notification status

## üí° Benefits

- **Time Efficiency**: Reduces manual tender searching from hours to seconds
- **Accuracy**: AI-powered analysis ensures relevant matches
- **Never Miss Out**: Automated monitoring catches every opportunity
- **Team Coordination**: Instant team notifications via Telegram
- **Cost Effective**: Minimizes human resources needed for tender discovery
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new sources or modify filtering criteria

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation

Built in just 3 days using:

- **CursorAI**: For rapid development assistance
- **LangGraph**: For workflow orchestration
- **Python**: As the primary programming language
- **AI Models**: GPT-4 and Claude for intelligent analysis

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- API keys for:
  - OpenAI (GPT-4)
  - Anthropic (Claude)
  - Telegram Bot

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:moe1047/scout-the-tender-finder.git
   cd scout-the-tender-finder
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   # Copy the example env file
   cp .env.example .env

   # Edit .env with your API keys
   nano .env
   ```

3. **Build and start the container**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Monitoring & Management

**View Logs**

```bash
# All logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Service logs
docker-compose logs -f scout

# Cron job logs
docker exec scout-agent cat /var/log/scout/cron.log
```

**Manual Trigger**

```bash
# Run the scraper manually
docker-compose exec scout python3 main.py
```

**Container Management**

```bash
# Stop the service
docker-compose down

# Restart the service
docker-compose restart scout

# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# Check container health
docker inspect scout-agent
```

### Configuration

- **Schedule**: Cron job runs every 2 days at midnight UTC
- **Persistence**:
  - Database: `./db/tenders.db`
  - Logs: `./logs/`
- **Timezone**: Set to Europe/London (configurable in docker-compose.yml)

### Troubleshooting

1. **Container won't start**

   - Check if all required environment variables are set in `.env`
   - Verify Docker daemon is running
   - Check logs for specific errors

2. **No notifications**

   - Verify Telegram bot token is correct
   - Check if bot has permission to send messages
   - Review cron logs for execution status

3. **Database issues**

   - Ensure `./db` directory has proper permissions
   - Check if volume is properly mounted

4. **Cron not running**
   - Verify timezone settings
   - Check cron logs
   - Ensure cron service is running inside container
