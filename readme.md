## üê≥ Docker Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- API keys for:
  - OpenAI (GPT-4)
  - Anthropic (Claude)
  - Telegram Bot

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:moe1047/scout-the-bid-finder.git
   cd scout-the-bid-finder
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   # Copy the example env file
   cp .env.example .env

   # Edit .env with your API keys
   nano .env
   ```

3. **Build and start the container**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Monitoring & Management

**View Logs**

```bash
# All logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Service logs
docker-compose logs -f scout

# Cron job logs
docker exec scout-agent cat /var/log/scout/cron.log
```

**Manual Trigger**

```bash
# Run the scraper manually
docker-compose exec scout python3 main.py
```

**Container Management**

```bash
# Stop the service
docker-compose down

# Restart the service
docker-compose restart scout

# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# Check container health
docker inspect scout-agent
```

### Configuration

- **Schedule**: Cron job runs every 2 days at midnight UTC
- **Persistence**:
  - Database: `./db/bids.db`
  - Logs: `./logs/`
- **Timezone**: Set to Europe/London (configurable in docker-compose.yml)

### Troubleshooting

1. **Container won't start**

   - Check if all required environment variables are set in `.env`
   - Verify Docker daemon is running
   - Check logs for specific errors

2. **No notifications**

   - Verify Telegram bot token is correct
   - Check if bot has permission to send messages
   - Review cron logs for execution status

3. **Database issues**

   - Ensure `./db` directory has proper permissions
   - Check if volume is properly mounted

4. **Cron not running**
   - Verify timezone settings
   - Check cron logs
   - Ensure cron service is running inside container
